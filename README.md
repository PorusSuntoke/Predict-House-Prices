# Predict-House-Prices
In this project I have prediced the prices of the houses depending on different input factors like number of bedrooms, nummber of bathrooms, square footage of the lot ... etc.
The dataset includes house sale prices for King County in USA.
It includes the homes that are sold in the time period from May 2014 and May 2015.
The dataset is available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
